    <p>Immersing myself in the world of how users think and feel fuels my enthusiasm and curiosity of human-centered design. Being a UX/UI Designer allows me to empathize with users and strategize to create the most instinctive and thoughtful designs, from start to finish. With a combined 11 years in event planning and sales, my process is influenced by research and understanding the user's needs and the client's goals to create a design solution that meets those needs holistically. </p>
